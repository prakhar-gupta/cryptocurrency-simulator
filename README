OUTPUT
-----------
- The simulator generates n output files named as out<node-no.>.txt. These
  files contains the blockchain tree as seen by the respective nodes.
- The blocks in the tree have
their siblings immediately below them and children connected to them to their
immediate right. 
- Each block has the following representation:
    <block-id> (<creator-node-id>, <time-of-reception>) [#<transaction-id>]

- The block-id 0 is for the genesis block.
- The longest chain can be seen to be the one ending in the rightmost block.
