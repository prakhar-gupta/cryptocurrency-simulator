COMPILATION
-----------
sh compile.sh


RUNNING
-----------
- ./simulator <n> <z> <mean-transaction-creation-time> <mean-block-creation-time>

	where n = number of nodes,
	z = percentage of slow nodes, and
	time unit is in ms

	If number of parameters passes are less than intended(4), the program will assume some default values for the remaining parameters.

	Default Values
	n : 5
	z : 30 (%)
	mean-transaction-creation-time : 10000
	mean-block-creation-time : 100000

- for help: ./simulator help


OUTPUT
-----------
- The simulator generates n output files named as out<node-no.>.txt. These
  files contains the blockchain tree as seen by the respective nodes.
- The blocks in the tree have
their siblings immediately below them and children connected to them to their
immediate right. 
- Each block has the following representation:
    <block-id> (<creator-node-id>, <time-of-reception>) [#<transaction-id>]

- The block-id 0 is for the genesis block.
- The longest chain can be seen to be the one ending in the rightmost block.
