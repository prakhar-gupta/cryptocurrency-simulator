\section{Transaction Generation}
Each peer generates transactions randomly in time. The interarrival between transactions generated by any peer is chosen from an exponential distribution whose mean time can be set as a parameter of the simulator.
The reason for this choice of transaction generation is the "memoryless property ..."

\section{Each peer is connected to a random number of other peers}

\section{Latencies}
- Bottleneck considered because:  ...\\
- Mean of $d_{ij}$ depends on $c_{ij}$ because faster links (i.e. greater $c$) means that queues would be smaller. Hence the mean value of $d$ increases with decrease in $c$
